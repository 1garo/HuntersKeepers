This is a Rails App that facilitates Monster of the Week Mysteries. [Monster of the Week](https://www.evilhat.com/home/monster-of-the-week/) is a role-playing game focused on supernatural horror. This project is WIP. Eventually, it will track player character sheets, and mystery details. Then, it'll handle tracking harm in a mystery session.

We're building this app to practice an hone our development skills. One goal of this application is to build a state of the art, free development environment to work in, and see what codebase results from that. Contributions (of all sorts) are welcome!
