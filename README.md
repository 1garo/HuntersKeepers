This is a Rails App that facilitates Monster of the Week Mysteries. [Monster of the Week](https://www.evilhat.com/home/monster-of-the-week/) is a role-playing game focused on supernatural horror. This project is WIP. Our first goal is tracking player character sheets. Eventually, we'd like to track mystery details and harm in a mystery session. [We're currently hosting it on Heroku if you want to check it out.](https://hunters-keepers.herokuapp.com/hunters)

We're building this app to practice and hone our development skills. One goal of this application is to implement a state of the art, free development environment to work in, and see what codebase results from that. Contributions (of all sorts) are welcome!

## Installation
Start by ensuring your development environment is ready for Rails. [GoRails has a great set of guides for every operating system.](https://gorails.com/setup)
